/*
Each person, excluding the user, must have at least three events with the following types:
    birth, marriage, and death. They may have additional events as well, but we will only be checking for these three.
The userâ€™s person object needs to have at least a birth event, and may have additional events, but we will only be checking for the birth event.
Parents must be born at least 13 years before their children.
Parents must be at least 13 years old when they are married.
Parents must not die before their child is born.
Women must not give birth when older than 50 years old.
Birth events must be the first event for a person chronologically.
Death events must be the last event for a person chronologically.
Nobody must die at an age older than 120 years old.
Each person in a married couple has their own marriage event. Each event will have a unique event ID,
    but both marriage events must have matching years and locations.
Event locations may be randomly selected, or you may try to make them more realistic
    (e.g., many people live their lives in a relatively small geographical area).
